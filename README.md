This Jupyter notebook is an almost-complete transcription of the article \"Sentiment Analysis: First Steps With Python's NLTK Library\" written by Marius Mogyorosi for RealPython.

The article can be found [here](https://realpython.com/python-nltk-sentiment-analysis).

I have removed and/or altered some portions of the original article to better fit the context of a Jupyter notebook.

Future plans are to use this notebook to aid in future work with sentiment analysis projects.

This project is worked on in my spare time from school and when I am feeling up to it - so, not very often.

I have begun to compile records of headline texts as well as headline sentiment scores + labels.

All scores were generated using the VADER model within NLTK.
