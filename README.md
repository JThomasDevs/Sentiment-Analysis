This Jupyter notebook is an almost-complete transcription of the article \"Sentiment Analysis: First Steps With Python's NLTK Library\" written by Marius Mogyorosi for RealPython.

The article can be found [here](https://realpython.com/python-nltk-sentiment-analysis).

I have removed and/or altered some portions of the original article to better fit the context of a Jupyter notebook.

Future plans are to use this notebook to aid in future work with sentiment analysis projects.
